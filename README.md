# Revolver.js

Revolver is a javascript library to help you build your own content slider. It has a sensable API that helps you get from mockup to reality with less friction than the other "cookie-cutter" sliders out there. 

In fact, Revolver is a much lower component than most others. It's more of a framework than it is a complete solution. So, naturally, hand-writing a little javascript comes with the terratory. But don't let any of that scare you, it's pretty easy to get started!

## Getting Started

For veterans, all you need to do is [install](#installation) Revolver and start customizing. However, if you are new to Revolver, it is highly recommended you study the [documentation](docs/README.md) and check out a few of the [examples](#examples).

## Examples

Because of Revolver's unopinionated philosophy, it does very little out of the box and usually requires some small amount of customization to hit the sweet spot.  Here are a few ideas to get you started:

* [**barebones-example**](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/revolverjs-barebones-example): An out-of-the-box example.
* [**fade-example**](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/revolverjs-fade-example): Slides fade in and out from each other using jQuery.
* [**reveal-example**](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/revolverjs-reveal-example): A Curtain transition using Qwery and Greensock.
* [**inception-example**](https://github.com/johnnyfreeman/revolverjs-inception-example): A slider within a slider using Mootools.
